| Bogdana Kolic        |Frontend/Fixes |- I made [EntryCard compatible with EntryRecap](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/87)<br>- Displayed the generated recaps<br>- We changed the way activities are stored in entry, so I modified the way they are displayed in EntryCard<br>- We now also store friends in activities, so I had to [remove friends](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/182) from EntryCard<br>- [Displayed all the habits](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/124) in the EntryCard<br>- [Synchronized EntryCard with currently tracked habits](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/132)<br>- Worked on fixing various bugs - stacking of text, deleted activities causing problems, ...<br>| - Further clean and optimize code|
| Liam Loughman        |Frontend       |Implemented a add function which adds a habit in the ui and allows user to select frequency, along with a save function which takes the habit and frequency given by the user and saves themt to a habits.txt file.

| Yubo Cai             |Frontend/Fixes | - I work on the seperation of Title and Text of the `TextEditor` and the display on `Card`. <br> - Fix the problem of saving entry of the title and data in order make the title and text and work and display independently. <br> - Fixed some functions of TextEditor.| - Optimize code and fix bugs. <br> - Solve the bug of title doesn't save on the first time of save|

| Brook Nigatu         |Data analysis  |- Added some edge case handling to the analysis functions|- Clean and optimize our code as much as possible|
| Artem Mamichev       |Data analysis  |- Work with data analysis team. <br>- Implemented NLP (c++ code calls python exe file with all needed hidden imports, so that the user doesn't have to download them to use the app, python code analyzes text in a text file and returns a value from -1 to 1 which stands for the mood) <br>- Created new class TextAnalysis and wrote a Wiki for it, changed MoodAnalysis structure so that TextAnalysis could inherit it's attributes. |- Testing neural network on different laptops. <br>- Cleaning code and commenting on it <br>- Final tests|
